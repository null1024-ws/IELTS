### 2. Do you think this is a good place to work?

Yes, I think SMU is really a good place to work. For salary, I can get 4k singapore dollars every month. It's totally enough for a single man like me. And every staff will be equipped with a new laptop or desktop. Plus, there are great benefits.

I have no work plans for the future. To be honest, it is my gap year currently. My job contract will end in April next year. After that, I hope I can get back to university to pursue the master degree or Ph.D. degree in the field of computer science.

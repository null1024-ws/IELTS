    <h1>Part 1</h1>
    <h2>Topic 1: Work</h2>

    <h3>1. Where do you work?</h3>
    <p>Currently I'm <u>working fulltime</u> as a research engineer at Singapore Management University. I've been working there for three months.</p>

    <h3>2. Do you think this is a good place to work?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I think SMU is really a good place to work. For salary, I can get 2k Singapore dollars every month. It's totally enough for a single man like me. And every staff will be equipped with a new laptop or desktop. Plus, there are great benefits.</p>

    <h3>3. What are your work plans for the future?</h3>
    <p>I have no work plans for the future. To be honest, it is my gap year currently. My job contract will end in April next year. After that, I hope I can get back to university to pursue the master degree or Ph.D. degree in the field of computer science.</p>

    <h3>4. What do you enjoy most about your work?</h3>
    <p>Oh, so many things. I am a research engineer, so I would say that the best part is doing research on cutting-edge technologies. This allows me to contribute to significant projects that have a real impact in my field.</p>

    <h3>5. Would you prefer to work from home or to go out to work?</h3>
    <p>That's a popular question these days, right? I prefer to work from home. That means no stress about being late, and I can focus on my work with fewer distractions.</p>

    <h3>6. Is there a job that you would like to do in the future?</h3>
    <p>That's a tough question. If I could choose, I would like to be a researcher at a major tech company. This would give me the opportunity to work on large-scale projects and collaborate with experts in the field. I believe being part of a big organization could significantly enhance my research capabilities and allow me to make a greater impact.</p>

    <h2>Topic 2: Home (The area you live in)</h2>

    <h3>1. Where are you living at the moment? (Please describe the place where you live.)</h3>
    <p>I'm living in an apartment in the Novena area. It is located within the central region of Singapore. So it's very easy to <u>take transit downtown</u>.</p>

    <h3>2. What's the best thing about the place where you live now?</h3>
    <p>There is a shopping center named Zhongshan Mall close to my home. It's only a five-minute walk for me. I like eating there.</p>

    <h3>3. Have you met many of your neighbors?</h3>
    <p>Honestly, I've only met a few. I leave early for work and come back late, so it's hard to meet people <u>because of my schedule</u>.</p>

    <h3>4. Is the area where you live now a busy or a quiet place?</h3>
    <p>I would say it's a very busy place. There are so many malls and medical centers in the Novena area. Life there is incredibly convenient, with everything you need just a short walk away.</p>

    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Do you have a bicycle now?</h3>

    </p>

     <h3>4. Do you think bicycles will be more or less popular in the future?</h3>

      <h3>2. Did you use coins more often in the past?/When you were a child, did you ever save coins in a money box?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I did. I used coins a lot when I was a child. <u>Back then</u>, people mostly used cash. I would <u>save the coins in a piggy bank</u> and use them to buy candy or toys.</p>

         city easily.</p>

      <h3>2. How easy is it to cross the roads in…/your area?</h3>

      <p> Yes, I think the roads need to be improved. The Singapore government should <u>invest in fixing them</u>. There's a

      <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 10: Teachers</h2>

      <h3>1. Did you have a favorite teacher at school?</h3>

      <h3>2. How have teachers helped you? Why?</h3>
      <p>My teachers taught me the basics I needed. Because of them, I've learned a lot. Besides, when I had trouble with something, they were always there to help me. I'm really grateful for their support and guidance.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Are you still in contact with any of your teachers from primary/elementary school?</h3>
      <p>No, I'm not. It has been almost ten years since I graduated from primary school. Back then, I didn't have a mobile phone or socail media and the relationship between teachers and students was different from today. So, I don't know how to find them now.</p>

      <h3>4. Would you like to be a teacher?</h3>
      <p>No, I would say no. I thinks being a teacher requires a lot of patience, and standing in front of so many students seems scray to me. So, it's not the best job for me.
         But teachers can enjoy long holidays, and they can help students grow and learn. It's a meaningful job.</p>


      <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 11: Fish and fishing</h2>

      <h3>1. Did you ever go fishing when you were a child?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I did. My father liked to go fishing, so he would like to take me with him. I remember we would get up early in the morning and go to the river. But I would say fishing has never interested me much because it took a lot of patience.</p>
      
      <h3>2. How popular is fishing as a hobby in.../your country?</h3>
      <p> Well, fishing has become more popular in China in recent years, especially with young people. It seems a good way to relax and enjoy nature. Instead of sitting at a desk all day, going fishing can help people get away from the city and enjoy the fresh air.</p>

      <h3>3. Do you like eating fish?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I do. I think fish is an important part of our diet. It's a good source of protein and other nutrients. I like to eat fish in different ways, such as steamed, fried, or grilled. It's delicious and healthy.</p>

      <h3>4. Have you ever been to a fish market?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I have. I went to a fish market in Qingdao when I was on vacation there two years ago. It was a big market with many kinds of fish and seafood. I still remember the smells and the noises as the sellers tried to get people's attention. It was a very interesting experience.</p>

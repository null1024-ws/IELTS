    <h1>Part 1</h1>
    <h2>Topic 1: Work</h2>

    <h3>1. Where do you work?</h3>
    <p>Currently I'm <u>working fulltime</u> as a research engineer at Singapore Management University. I've been working there for three months.</p>

    <h3>2. Do you think this is a good place to work?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I think SMU is really a good place to work. For salary, I can get 2k Singapore dollars every month. It's totally enough for a single man like me. And every staff will be equipped with a new laptop or desktop. Plus, there are great benefits.</p>

    <h3>3. What are your work plans for the future?</h3>
    <p>I have no work plans for the future. To be honest, it is my gap year currently. My job contract will end in April next year. After that, I hope I can get back to university to pursue the master degree or Ph.D. degree in the field of computer science.</p>

    <h3>4. What do you enjoy most about your work?</h3>
    <p>Oh, so many things. I am a research engineer, so I would say that the best part is doing research on cutting-edge technologies. This allows me to contribute to significant projects that have a real impact in my field.</p>

    <h3>5. Would you prefer to work from home or to go out to work?</h3>
    <p>That's a popular question these days, right? I prefer to work from home. That means no stress about being late, and I can focus on my work with fewer distractions.</p>

    <h3>6. Is there a job that you would like to do in the future?</h3>
    <p>That's a tough question. If I could choose, I would like to be a researcher at a major tech company. This would give me the opportunity to work on large-scale projects and collaborate with experts in the field. I believe being part of a big organization could significantly enhance my research capabilities and allow me to make a greater impact.</p>

    <h2>Topic 2: Home (The area you live in)</h2>

    <h3>1. Where are you living at the moment? (Please describe the place where you live.)</h3>
    <p>I'm living in an apartment in the Novena area. It is located within the central region of Singapore. So it's very easy to take transit downtown.</p>

    <h3>2. What's the best thing about the place where you live now?</h3>
    <p>There is a shopping center named Zhongshan Mall close to my home. It's only a five-minute walk for me. I like eating there.</p>

    <h3>3. Have you met many of your neighbors?</h3>
    <p>Honestly, I've only met a few. I leave early for work and come back late, so it's hard to meet people because of my schedule.</p>

    <h3>4. Is the area where you live now a busy or a quiet place?</h3>
    <p>I would say it's a very busy place. There are so many malls and medical centers in the Novena area. Life there is incredibly convenient, with everything you need just a short walk away.</p>

    <h2>Topic 3: Bicycles</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Did you ride a bike when you were a child?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I had a bike when I was young. I love riding around my neighborhood with my friends. Going down big hills was so exciting!
       I would <u>lift my feet off the pedals</u> and go fast.</p>
    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Do you have a bicycle now?</h3>
    <p>No, I don't have a bike now. I would say Singapore is a good city for biking, but the weather here is too hot. 
       I prefer to take the bus or MRT to work.</p>
    </p>

    <h3>3. Are bicycles popular in…/your country?</h3>
    <p>Yes, biking is very popular in Singapore. There are lots of <u>bike paths</u> designed for bikers, both in the city center and outside the city.
       Many people bike in the parks on weekends, and some also bike to school or work.</p>
    </p>

     <h3>4. Do you think bicycles will be more or less popular in the future?</h3>
     <p>I would say bikes will become popular. Traffic is getting worse, and it's hard to get anywhere on time <u>during rush hour</u>.
        But with a bike, you don't have to worry about traffic jams. It's a better way to travel, so
        more people will use bikes in the future.</p>

     <h2>Topic 4: Where you live now/Hometown</h2>
     
     <h3>1. Do you live in a town, a city or the countryside?</h3>
     <p>I live in Singapore now. It is a beautiful city with lots of <u>amazing attractions</u>, and people are warm and friendly.</p>

     <h3>2. What do you like best about living in…/this place?</h3>
     <p>Oh, so many things. I love the parks and green spaces the best in Singapore. They are so beautiful and well-maintained. People here can enjoy the outdoors time with their families.</p>

     <h3>3. Would you recommend living in…/ this place to other people?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I would. If someone is looking for a place to live, Singapore is a great choice. They can <u>start a family</u> or find a job. There are many opportunities and resources to help them. It's a good place for the future.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Is that a big city or a small place?</h3>
      <p>Singapore is a small city, but the facilities and services here are very advanced. It's a convenient place to live.</p>

      <h3>5. How long have you lived there?</h3>
      <p>I have lived in Singapore for two years. I moved here and started working after I graduated from university.</p>

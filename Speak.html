    <h1>Part 1</h1>
    <h2>Topic 1: Work</h2>

    <h3>1. Where do you work?</h3>
    <p>Currently I'm <u>working fulltime</u> as a research engineer at Singapore Management University. I've been working there for three months.</p>

    <h3>2. Do you think this is a good place to work?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I think SMU is really a good place to work. For salary, I can get 2k Singapore dollars every month. It's totally enough for a single man like me. And every staff will be equipped with a new laptop or desktop. Plus, there are great benefits.</p>

    <h3>3. What are your work plans for the future?</h3>
    <p>I have no work plans for the future. To be honest, it is my gap year currently. My job contract will end in April next year. After that, I hope I can get back to university to pursue the master degree or Ph.D. degree in the field of computer science.</p>

    <h3>4. What do you enjoy most about your work?</h3>
    <p>Oh, so many things. I am a research engineer, so I would say that the best part is doing research on cutting-edge technologies. This allows me to contribute to significant projects that have a real impact in my field.</p>

    <h3>5. Would you prefer to work from home or to go out to work?</h3>
    <p>That's a popular question these days, right? I prefer to work from home. That means no stress about being late, and I can focus on my work with fewer distractions.</p>

    <h3>6. Is there a job that you would like to do in the future?</h3>
    <p>That's a tough question. If I could choose, I would like to be a researcher at a major tech company. This would give me the opportunity to work on large-scale projects and collaborate with experts in the field. I believe being part of a big organization could significantly enhance my research capabilities and allow me to make a greater impact.</p>

    <h2>Topic 2: Home (The area you live in)</h2>

    <h3>1. Where are you living at the moment? (Please describe the place where you live.)</h3>
    <p>I'm living in an apartment in the Novena area. It is located within the central region of Singapore. So it's very easy to <u>take transit downtown</u>.</p>

    <h3>2. What's the best thing about the place where you live now?</h3>
    <p>There is a shopping center named Zhongshan Mall close to my home. It's only a five-minute walk for me. I like eating there.</p>

    <h3>3. Have you met many of your neighbors?</h3>
    <p>Honestly, I've only met a few. I leave early for work and come back late, so it's hard to meet people <u>because of my schedule</u>.</p>

    <h3>4. Is the area where you live now a busy or a quiet place?</h3>
    <p>I would say it's a very busy place. There are so many malls and medical centers in the Novena area. Life there is incredibly convenient, with everything you need just a short walk away.</p>

    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Do you have a bicycle now?</h3>

    <p>Yes, biking is very popular in Singapore. There are lots of <u>bike paths</u> designed for bikers, both in the city center and outside the city.

    </p>

     <h3>4. Do you think bicycles will be more or less popular in the future?</h3>
     <p>I would say bikes will become popular. Traffic is getting worse, and it's hard to get anywhere on time <u>during rush hour</u>.
        But with a bike, you don't have to worry about traffic jams. It's a better way to travel, so
        more people will use bikes in the future.</p>

      <h3>1. Do you like to have some coins with you when you go out?</h3>
      <p> No, <u>I hardly ever have coins with me</u>. You know, most places in Singapore take cards now. So I prefer to use my credit card or mobile payment apps like PayNow or Google Pay.</p>

      <h3>2. Did you use coins more often in the past?/When you were a child, did you ever save coins in a money box?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I did. I used coins a lot when I was a child. <u>Back then</u>, people mostly used cash. I would <u>save the coins in a piggy bank</u> and use them to buy candy or toys.</p>

      <h3>3. Do you think that collecting unusual coins is an interesting hobby to have?</h3>
      <p> Yes! Collecting rare coins is fun. Some coins are hard to find, so they might be very valuable. Also, these coins often have <u>interesting connections to different cultures and histories</u>. You can learn a lot from them.</p>

      <h2 style="color: red;"> Topic 6: Laughing and things that are funny</h2>

      <h3>1. Do you enjoy watching films/movies that are funny?</h3>
      <p> Yes! I think a movie that makes me laugh is a great form of entertainment. It can help me relax and forget my worries after a long day at work.</p>

      <h3>2. When was the last time something made you laugh?</h3>
      <p>Um... The last time I laughed really hard was when I watched a funny video that my friend farwarded to me. It was about screwing over passengers in a taxi. I couldn't stop laughing!</p>

      <h3>3. Are you good at making people laugh?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I think so. I can come up with many funny comments quickly. I make my friends laugh, and I enjoy that. It's fun to laugh with friends, and it feels even better <u>to be the one who makes them laugh</u>.</p>

      <h3>4. Do you think it's always good to make people laugh?</h3>
      <p>Yes! <u>Laughter is the best medicine</u>. It can help people relax and forget about stress. Also, it's a great way to connect with others and make friends. So, I think it's always good to make people laugh.</p>

      <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 7: Roads</h2>

      <h3>1. Are the roads and streets very busy near where you live?</h3>
      <p> Yes, I live in the Novena area, which is located within the central region of Singapore. Furthermore, I <u>live near a main road</u>, so there's a lot of traffic around my neighborhood. But I don't mind it because I can reach important places in the
         city easily.</p>

      <h3>2. How easy is it to cross the roads in…/your area?</h3>
      <p> I would say it's quite easy for people in Singapore to cross the roads. They can press the button at the traffic lights, <u>use the pedestrian crossing</u>, and wait for the green light. Also, there are <u>pedestrian bridges</u> and underpasses in some places to help people cross the roads safely.</p>

      <h3>3. Is there anything you would like to change about the roads in…/your area?</h3>
      <p> Yes, I think the roads need to be improved. The Singapore government should <u>invest in fixing them</u>. There's a
         lot of <u>heavy traffic</u> now, especially more big trucks, so the roads need to be stronger to handle it. 

       <h3>4. Is there a road or street in…/your country that is very famous?</h3> 
       <p>Yes! In Singapore, Orchard Road is a famous street. It's a major shopping street in the city center. There are many shopping malls, restaurants, and hotels along the road. It's a popular place for tourists and locals to visit.</p>

       <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 8: Feeling calm and relaxed</h2>

       <h3>1. Have you visited a place recently where you felt calm and relaxed?</h3>
       <p>Yes, I visited the Fort Canning Park last weekend which is located near SMU. I took a walk there after dinner with my friends. There are many trees and flowers in the park, and the air is fresh. It's a great place to relax and enjoy nature.</p>

       <h3>2. Do you find listening to music a relaxing thing to do?</h3>
       <p>Sometimes, yes. When I'm writing codes, I like to play music in the background to help me cut out distractions and focus on my work. Also, when I feel stressed, I listen to soft music to help me relax and calm down.</p>

       <h3>3. Would you ever do exercise, to help you feel calm and relaxed?</h3>
       <p>Yes, I would. For me, exercise is the best way to relax. It helps <u>release the stress of the day</u>. Besides, our
         bodies need to move, and many of us sit too much. So, exercise is important for staying healthy and also
         helps me relax.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Are you usually a calm and relaxed person?</h3>
      <p>No. I can be quite stressed sometimes and worry about uncertain things I can't control easily. But now I try to <u>manage my stress</u> better by doing meditation. It helps me stay calm and relaxed.</p>
      
      <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 9: Perfume</h2>

      <h3>1. Do you like to wear perfume/aftershave?</h3>
      <p>No, I'm not into wearing perfume; it's just too strong for me. I just stick to lightly scented detergent to keep my clothes smelling fresh. </p>

      <h3>2. Have you ever bought a bottle of perfume/aftershave as a present/gift? </h3>
      <p>Yes, I have. Once I bought a bottle of perfume for my best friend. She said she would have a job interview, so I thought it would be a good gift to help her feel more confident and make a good impression. She was really happy and thankful when she got it.</p>

      <h3>3. Do you have a favorite type of perfume/aftershave?</h3>
      <p>N.A.</p>

      <h3>4. Would you pay a lot for a bottle of perfume/aftershave?</h3>
      <p> I spend more money on perfume when I buy it as a gift for someone else. But for myself, I don't think I would pay a lot for a bottle of perfume. I prefer to spend money on other things like eletronic gadgets or shoes.</p>

      <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 10: Teachers</h2>

      <h3>1. Did you have a favorite teacher at school?</h3>
      <p> Well, I remember the math teacher I had in my high school. He was full of energy and always made the class interesting. He could make difficult concepts easy to understand. I learned a lot from him and enjoyed his class very much.</p>

      <h3>2. How have teachers helped you? Why?</h3>
      <p>My teachers taught me the basics I needed. Because of them, I've learned a lot. Besides, when I had trouble with something, they were always there to help me. I'm really grateful for their support and guidance.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Are you still in contact with any of your teachers from primary/elementary school?</h3>
      <p>No, I'm not. It has been almost ten years since I graduated from primary school. Back then, I didn't have a mobile phone or socail media and the relationship between teachers and students was different from today. So, I don't know how to find them now.</p>

      <h3>4. Would you like to be a teacher?</h3>
      <p>No, I would say no. I thinks being a teacher requires a lot of patience, and standing in front of so many students seems scray to me. So, it's not the best job for me.
         But teachers can enjoy long holidays, and they can help students grow and learn. It's a meaningful job.</p>


      <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 11: Fish and fishing</h2>

      <h3>1. Did you ever go fishing when you were a child?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I did. My father liked to go fishing, so he would like to take me with him. I remember we would get up early in the morning and go to the river. But I would say fishing has never interested me much because it took a lot of patience.</p>
      
      <h3>2. How popular is fishing as a hobby in.../your country?</h3>
      <p> Well, fishing has become more popular in China in recent years, especially with young people. It seems a good way to relax and enjoy nature. Instead of sitting at a desk all day, going fishing can help people get away from the city and enjoy the fresh air.</p>

      <h3>3. Do you like eating fish?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I do. I think fish is an important part of our diet. It's a good source of protein and other nutrients. I like to eat fish in different ways, such as steamed, fried, or grilled. It's delicious and healthy.</p>

      <h3>4. Have you ever been to a fish market?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I have. I went to a fish market in Qingdao when I was on vacation there two years ago. It was a big market with many kinds of fish and seafood. I still remember the smells and the noises as the sellers tried to get people's attention. It was a very interesting experience.</p>

       <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 12: Childhood</h2>

       <h3>1. Where did you like to play when you were a child?</h3>
       <p>As a kid, I was very active. I enjoyed riding my bike around the neighborhood with my friends. I also liked to play soccer in the park. It was a lot of fun.</p>

       <h3>2. Who did you spend most time with when you were a child?</h3>
       <p>When I was a child, I spent most of my time with my sister. Our parents were busy with work, so it was often just the two of us. We are close in age, so we had the same friends and did a lot of things together.</p>

       <h3>3. Is there anything you enjoyed doing as a child that you still enjoy now?</h3>
       <p>Yes. I still enjoy playing soccer, just like when I was younger. Although I don't have as much time to play now, I still try to get together with friends for a game whenever I can. It's a great way to stay active and have fun.</p>
       
       <h3>4. What do you think is the best thing about being a child?</h3>
       <p>Oh... The best thing about being a child is that you don't have to worry about anything. You can just play and have fun all day long. You don't have to think about work or bills or anything like that.</p> 


       <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 13: T-shirt</h2>
      
       <h3>1. How often do you wear a T-shirt?</h3>
       <p> I wear T-shirts almost every day as the weather in Singapore is hot and humid all year round. They can <u>go well with almost anything</u>. You can wear them with jeans <u>for a casual look</u> or add a jacket to make it more formal. And they are very convenient to wash and dry.</p>
       <h3>2. Did you wear T-shirts when you were a child?</h3>
       <p>Yes, I did. They were very easy to match with my jeans and easy to wash, so my parents bought many for me. I liked them because they were comfortable and some <u>have cool designs</u>.</p>
       <h3>3. Would you ever give someone a T-shirt as a gift?</h3>
       <p>No, I don't think so. It's hard to know someone's size, and you don't want to get the wrong one. It could embarrass them. So I don't think it's a good choice for a gift.</p>
       <h3>4. Do you often look at the T-shirts that other people are wearing?</h3>
       <p>Not really. I usually look at my phone while walking, so I don't notice what others wear. But if I see someone wearing a T-shirt with a cool design, I might take a second look.</p>

       <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 14: Meeting new people</h2>
       <h3>1. Do you enjoy meeting new people?</h3>
       <P>Yes, I do. I think meeting new people is a great way to be open to possibilities and new ideas. It can help me see things from different perspectives. Besides, <u>you never know when you might need to call on someone for help or advice</u> in the future.</p>

      <h3>2. Have you met anyone new recently?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Last month, I attended an AI security summit held in Singapore and made some new friends there. We talked about the latest trends in this reseach field and shared our ongoing projects. It's great to network with <u>like-minded people</u> and enrich my social circle.</p>


      <h3>3. Did you meet new people more often when you were younger?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I think so. When I was a kid, the school wasn't as tough, so I'd go to amusement parks, museums, and other places with my parents. <u>Meeting new people just happend naturally</u>. But now, I'm mostly going between work and home, so I don't have as many opportunities to meet new people.</p>

      <h3>4. What do you usually talk about when you meet new people for the first time?</h3>
      <p> I think it depends on the situation. If I meet someone at a party, I might ask about their job or hobbies. If I meet someone at a conference, I might ask about their research or projects. I try to find common ground and keep the conversation light and interesting.</p>

     <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 15: Working in groups</h2>
     <h3>1.  Did you work in groups when you were a child at primary/elemnentary school?</h3>
     <p> Yes, I worked in teams when I was a child. Our teachers often asked us to get into groups and work on assignments together. Sometimes it got pretty chaotic, but it actually helped me gain some teamwork skills.</p>
     <h3>2. Do you often work or study in a group now?</h3>
     <p>Yes, I do. Currently I'm working on a fuzzing project with my colleagues. We are responsible for different parts of the project, so we need to work together to make sure everything is on track. It's a great way to share ideas and learn from each other.</p>
     <h3>3. How have you been benefited from working in a group?</h3>
     <p>I think working in a group has definitely been a big help. It teaches you really valuable skills like cooperation and communication. You have to coordinate with others to get things done, which improves your people skills and demands a lot of patience and organization. So, it's a great way to learn and grow.</p>
     <h3>4. If there anything you don't like about working in a group?</h3>
     <p> That's an interesting question. I think the biggest challenge of working in a group is dealing with different personalities. Everyone has their own ideas and opinions, so it can be hard to reach a consensus sometimes. But I think it's important to be open-minded and willing to compromise to make the group work.</p>

     <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 16: Views people enjoy</h2>
     <h3>1. Are there any places with a good view where you live?</h3>
     <p>Well, currently I live in Singapore, and there are many places with great views here. For example, the skypark observation deck at Marina Bay Sands offers a stunning view of the city skyline. It's a popular spot for tourists and locals alike.</p>
     <h3>2. What's the best view you have ever seen?</h3>
     <p> Last year, my friends and I went on a hiking trip to Mount Huang in Anhui Province, China. The view from the top was absolutely breathtaking. We could see the sea of clouds below us and the peaks of the mountains in the distance. It was a truly unforgettable experience.</p>
     <h3>3. Do you always take photos when you see a good view?</h3>
     <p> Yes, I love capturing beautiful views with my phone. On the one hand, it's nice to bask in the moment and enjoy what you see. But on the other hand, taking photos allows you to relive the experience later and share it with others. So, I think it's a great way to preserve memories.</p>
     <h3>4. Do you try to have a room with a good view when you're on holiday/vacation?</h3>
     <p> Acutally not. Usually, I spend most of my time outside exploring the sights and attractions of the place I'm visiting. So, I don't really care about having a room with a good view. As long as it's clean and comfortable, I'm happy.</p>

     <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 17: Things you find exciting</h2>
     <h3>1. What kind of things did you find exciting when you were a child?</h3>
     <p> When I was younger, I found anything related to technology exciting. I loved playing video games and reading books about robots and space. I was always curious about how things worked and wanted to learn more about the world around me.</p>

     <h3>2. Have you done anything that you found exciting recently?</h3>
     <p> No, I haven't tried exciting activities recently. I've been busy with work at SMU and preparing for my IELTS exam, so I haven't had much time to get out of my comfort zone and do some new exciting activities.</p>

     <h3>3. Would you prefer to have an exciting holiday/vacation or a relaxing holiday/vacation?</h3>
     <p>I would say I prefer a more relaxing holiday. To be honest, my life is already busy and stressful enough, so I really wish I could slow things down a bit and enjoy some peace and quiet of being alone. A day with no work or studies, just chilling on the beach, would be perfect.</p>

     <h3>4. Do you think spots like climbing or deep-sea diving are exciting?</h3>
     <p>Yes, I definitely think that activities like climbing and diving are exciting. There's a lot of stake with both activities and they can be quite dangerous, but that's what makes them so thrilling. They push you out of your comfort zone and challenge you to overcome your fears. So, I think they're a great way to get your adrenaline pumping and have some fun.</p>

     <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 18: Mornings</h2>
     <h3>1. Is a breakfast an important meal for you?</h3>
     <p> Yes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day for me. It gives me the eneygy I need to start my day and helps me stay focused. I usually have a youtiao and an egg with a cup of soy milk for breakfast. It's a simple meal, but it keeps me full and satisfied until lunchtime.</p>

     <h3>2. Do you like to have the same routine every morning?</h3>
     <p> Yes, I prefer having the same routine every morning. I think having a routine helps me stay organized and get things done more efficiently. It also gives me a sense of stability and control over my day. If I switch up my routine too much, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by all the changes.</p>

     <h3>3. Was your morning routine very different when you were younger?</h3>
     <p>Yes, it was a bit different. When I was younger, I had a lot more energy in the mornings. I could play with my toys until it was time to get ready for school. Now, I'm more focused on getting things done and being productive in the mornings.</p>

     <h3>4. Is there anything you would like to change about your morning now?</h3>
     <p> I'd like to wake up early enough to work out in the mornings before I head out for the day. I think it's a great way to start the day with something positive.</p>

     <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 19: Internet</h2>
     <h3>1. How often do you use the Internet?</h3>
     <p> Well, every day! Internet is an essential part of my life. I use the internet for tons of things, whether it's <u>catching up with people over social media</u> or <u>staying up to date with the news</u>. It's hard to imagine life without the Internet now.</p>
     <h3>2. Do you think you spend too much time on the Internet?</h3>
     <p> Definitely yes. I do waste a lot of time watching videos on YouTube and scrolling over social media. I know it's not good for me, but it's hard to put my phone or computer away sometimes. </p>
     <h3>3. Can you remember a time when you are not allowed to use the Internet?</h3>
     <p> Yes. When I was in middle school, my mom was working from home one day. I was playing video games, but the Internet was being really slow and  my mom needed it more than I did for her work. So she asked me to disconnect from the Internet until she was done with her work.</p>
     <h3>4. What would you do if you had no access to the Internet for a day?</h3>
     <p> I have no idea what I would do without the Internet for a day. I would feel pretty anxious without it, as I'm online all the time. Without Internet access, I guess I would take a walk in the park, read a book, or maybe do some cleaning around the house.</p>

     <h2 style="color: red;">Topic 20: Studying language</h2>
     <h3>1. Which language did you study at school?</h3>
     <p> English is the only foreign language I have learned in school. And I have been learning it since the first grade. Luckily, it has come in very handy while traveling as it seems most people know at least a little bit of English.</p>
     <h3>2. Was there anything you didn't enjoy about studying languages at school?</h3>
     <p> What I found most chanllenging about studying languages in school was lack of practice. You know, we spent a lot of time on grammar and vocabulary, but we didn't get many chances have conversaionts with native speakers. I think that would have improved my learning experience a lot.</p>
     <h3>3. Do you think it's important for all students in your country to learn a foreign language?</h3>
     <p> Honestly, I don't think it's necessary for all students to learn a second language. It can pretty hard for someone because not everyone has a natural talent for it. Plus, a lot of people wont' use a foreign language in their future jobs or daily lives. So, I think it should be optional.</p>

### 1. Where do you work?
```
Currently I'm a research engineer working at Singapore Management University. I've been working there for three months.
```
### 2. Do you think this is a good place to work?
```
Yes, I think SMU is really a good place to work. For salary, I can get 4k singapore dollars every month. It's totally enough for a single man like me. And every staff will be equipped with a new laptop or desktop. Plus, there are great benefits.
```
### 3. What are your work plans for the future?
```
I have no work plans for the future. To be honest, it is my gap year currently. My job contract will end in April next year. After that, I hope I can get back to university to pursue the master degree or Ph.D. degree in the field of computer science.
```
### 4. What do you enjoy most about your work?
```
Oh, so many things. I am a research engineer, so I would say that the best part is doing research on cutting-edge technologies. This allows me to contribute to significant projects that have a real impact in my field.
```
### 5. Would you prefer to work from home or to go out to work?
```
That's a popular question these days, right? I prefer to work from home. That means no stress about being late, and I can focus on my work with fewer distractions.
```
### 6. Is there a job that you would like to do in the future?
```
That's a tough question. If I could choose, I would like to be a researcher at a major tech company. This would give me the opportunity to work on large-scale projects and collaborate with experts in the field. I believe being part of a big organization could significantly enhance my research capabilities and allow me to make a greater impact.
